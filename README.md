THIS HAS SOME ISSUES! sometimes roblox ratelimits for longer than the 1 minute so it gets stuck in ratelimit loop
if this happened just restart, the trades are cached so it's fine






requires python 3+




requirements:
colorama
requests




proxyless, single threaded - 100 trades checked/declined every 3 minutes - using proxies doesnt bypass ratelimit so i didn't
